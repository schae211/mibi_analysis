# Analysis of multiplexed ion beam imaging (spatial proteomics) dataset from "A Structured Tumor-Immune Microenvironment in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Revealed by Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging" by Keren, L. et al.

## DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.039
## Journal: Cell 174, 1373-1387.e19 (2018).
  
# What kind of analysis were conducted?

- "Exploratory Data Analysis" contains the preliminary analysis of the data
including visualization about the abundance of different cell types, 
composition of the different samples, results for running MISTy on
all cells in each sample.

- "MISTy Stratification" contains a fine grained analysis of the spatial
data by using MISTy with certain subsets of the data only including 
certain cell types.
