# File Descriptions

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory and preliminary analysis of the data
including visualization about the abundance of different cell types, 
composition of the different samples, results for running MISTy on
all cells in each sample.

## Cell Type Specific Analysis

Running MISTy on certain cell type subsets only considering effects from
another subset for the calculation of the paraview.
