# Questions

1. How does the site/location in the solid tumor where the sample is taken from
influence the sample-to-sample heterogeneity?

2. What are the different markers indicative of?
- Tumor-related: EGFR, p53, (also CD138 neoplastic cells?)
- Metabolic activity / proliferation: Ki-67, pS6
- Immunoregulatory proteins: PD-1, PD-L1, LAG3, IDO
- Plasma cells: CD138
- Macrophages: CD209, CD11c, 

3. On which other MIBI datasets could we test MISTy on?
- Spatio-temporal coordination at the maternal-fetal interface promotes 
trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling in the first half of human pregnancy

4. Can I simply take the mean p-values when looking whether the gain in 
variance is significant for a given target?
