# Questions

1. How does the site/location in the solid tumor where the sample is taken from
influence the sample-to-sample heterogeneity?
- See discussion of the paper: Emerging cohorts, in which several regions are 
profiled for each patient, are needed to investigate the intra-patient 
heterogeneity in the composition and architecture of the tumor-immune 
microenvironment and its relationship to the molecular attributes of the tumor.
- 

2. What are the different markers indicative of?
- Tumor-related: EGFR, p53, (also CD138 neoplastic cells?)
- Metabolic activity / proliferation: Ki-67, pS6
- Immunoregulatory proteins: PD-1, PD-L1, LAG3, IDO
- Plasma cells: CD138
- Macrophages: CD209, CD11c, 

3. On which other MIBI datasets could we test MISTy on?
- Spatio-temporal coordination at the maternal-fetal interface promotes 
trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling in the first half of human pregnancy

4. Can I simply take the mean p-values when looking whether the gain in 
variance is significant for a given target?
- Or is this rather stupid because the p-values can have a high variability
between the samples

5. Do we even have enough markers to discover cell-cell interaction?
- As I understand it most markers were chosen to distinguish between different
cell types, but we get little information about the cell states (meaning, 
what is actually going on in those cells).

6. What factors could explain that we can sometimes explain more or less 
variance for certain target in certain samples? What drives the performance
of MISTy?
